# Airport Web Mapping Project 


The objective of this project was to create a web map of all the airports in the United States in the year 2012 using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript coding.
Based on the number of airports in each state, a choropleth map was created that can be used to categorize each of the individual states into different categories. 
Choropleth maps can be used to easily distinguish and compare two different states against one another at a basic level without needing prior knowledge of analytics.
Furthermore, the map includes an interactive element in which you can select an airport location and the name of the airport will appear in the pop up box. The map also includes whether or not each airport has an air traffic control tower or not.

The libraries used to produce this webmap include: Leaflet, Font Awesome, JavaScript (ex: Chroma.js), and Ajax.
Data of the airports was downloaded from the United States Geological Survey Data Catalog, and the geojson data file containing all state boundaries in the United States was acquired from Mike Bostock of D3.

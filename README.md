# Airport Web Mapping Project 


The objective of this project was to create a web map of all the airports in the United States in the year 2012 using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript coding.
Based on the number of airports in each state, a choropleth map was created that can be used to categorize each of the individual states into different categories. 
Choropleth maps can be used to easily distinguish and compare two different states against one another at a basic level without needing prior knowledge of analytics.
Furthermore, the map includes an interactive element in which you can select an airport location and the name of the airport will appear in the pop up box. The map also includes whether or not each airport has an air traffic control tower or not. Based on the interactive map, the viewer can see that states with larger populations and area size, such as California Texas, and Florida, tend to have a higher quantity of airports and airports with air traffic control towers than smaller states in size and population, such as Oregon. One explanation of this has to do with the large populations that these states with higher airport counts must be responsible for in regards to travel. Furthermore, states such as California and Florida can also be considered destination targets for tourism and business ventures, which may also contribute to the higher quantities in airports and air traffic control towers in these states.

The libraries used to produce this webmap include: Leaflet, Font Awesome, JavaScript (ex: Chroma.js), and Ajax.
Data of the airports was downloaded from the United States Geological Survey Data Catalog, and the geojson data file containing all state boundaries in the United States was acquired from Mike Bostock of D3.
